Internals
Copyright 2002 Ian Burrell


Functionality

This program displays system information on Palm OS handhelds. It
displays information on the operating system, processor, display,
battery, memory, and databases. It can list the heaps and their
sizes. It can list all the databases, display the attributes, list the
records, and display the data in records.


Requirements

Requires PalmOS 2.0 or higher. It shouldn't crash on Palm OS 1.0 but
it may be missing some functionality like scroll bars.


Testing

This software was tested under POSE with all Palm distributed ROMs. It
was also tested on a PalmPilot Professional. I would appreciate
reports from people running newer hardware, especially for devices not
manufactured by Palm.
